# CS-583-Deep-Learning

This repository contains my solutions to assignments for the Deep Learning Class offered by Stevens.

Assignment 1 - Involved implementing Regularized logistic regression with Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini Batch Gradient Descent from scratch to train 6 different models.

Assignment 2 - Involved building a CNN architecture for image recognition using Tensorflow and Keras and applying reqularization techniques such as Batch normalization and Dropout

Assignment 3 - Involved building a Seq2Seq model for machine translation using LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM and evaluating the resulting model using the BLEU score metric.

Assignment 4 - Involved building an unsupervised and a supervised Autoencoder for image classification using Tensorflow, Keras, the result of this prooject helped to demonstrate that supervised autoencoders are able to learn low-dimensional features which are highly discriminative and yeild better accuracies as compared to their unsupervised counterparts.
